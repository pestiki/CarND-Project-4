# CarND-Project-4
Project 4 submitted for first term of Udacity self-driving cars course.

This is my implementatoin for computer vision for detecting lane lines in a freeway. The provided video feed is very clean and this code does not cover the challenges of distractions, imperfections, trash or extra lines on the road. It also does not cover the issue dirty camera lens cover. All cameras are protected by some kind of enclosure. They can be behinde windshield or prtected inside a box with a glass opening.
